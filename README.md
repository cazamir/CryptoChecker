## Preface
Full project files for CryptoChecker.

This is *not* a ready-to-use program, it is missing a lot of core features and has a multitude of issues. As such it is highly recommended that you do not use this if you have no prior programming knowledge or a lack of programming knowledge in general.

## Known issues
- Unoptimized code.

## FAQ

### How do I use it?
To use CryptoChecker you first have to have a linux command line with bash installed, and then you have to have docker.
After you've checked you have both of those, while in the CryptoChecker directory type "make start" in the command line. If this does not work and gives you a error, make sure Make is installed, to install Make here are some common package manager commands you can use:
> Pacman
> Homebrew
> Apt
> Zypper 
> Nix
